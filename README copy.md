## Final Checkpoint 
1. Paola Hernandez Aguirre
2. Since I have a scroll page, everything is mobile friendly. 
3. I ran into issues with spacing and colors for my pages. I feel like some of the colors I had either did not look as coherent as I would have liked or they just in general lacked what I was expecting out of them and had to do a lot of workarounds. 
4. I still need to fill in all the information in the about me section and the projects (I was not able to get around to do the actual planning on the exact content I wanted here). For the projects, I also want to do a individual project the user can be redirected to from the projects section when they click on the title. Right now, I have a link to the website itself but I want to develop that further. I might also go back in and mess around with the colors a little more to reduce them or make it more monochromatic. 
5. I did not use any libraries/packages beyond the defaults provided.

## Write up

Since we also want to hear your thought process, we are asking you to use the
project’s README.md to describe your web pages in a short write-up. There is no
requirement for how long it should be, but it should be just enough for us to
understand any complications or shortcomings in your design process, what you
plan on changing, what you did change between your mockup and this, and
anything else significant.

### Design considerations 
- For checkpoint #2, I worked on the Home page and the Contact page
- Home: 
    - For this page, some changes I made from the original idea was that I changed the nav bar to be the the same as with the other pages. I originally had made it different because I wanted to give more attention to the image. I also do like how it looks just the same thought, and it was slightly easier to implement. I might experiment changing this to be more transparent in the future but for now, I like how it looks. 
    - I also changed the font and location of where it is to make it stand out more. Originally, I had put a drop shadow on the text (and on the nav bar) because I thought that made it stand out more. Through the feedback I got, I realized this was actually doing the opposite so I just took it out completely. 

- About:
    - Changed background color. Since I made a long scroll page, I thought that changing the background colors of the backgrounds would be good to differentiate one section from another. 
    - Changed the picture to be circular. Right now, I'm debating if I should make the text wrap around the image or if i prefer it like this.
    - Going forward, I want to probably add some kind of stats or other quick text at the bottom that talks about my skills or other quick facts. I have seen other portfolios do things like this and I think its pretty cool, reminds me of video game stats which is nice. 

- Projects: 
    - For now, I like the cards that I had made when I was working on the design but I'm still deciding exactly how I want to format the projects within them. 
    - Still finalizing the colors for some things though. I started using different shades and tints of my original three colors because sometimes the colors I wanted to use would not give me enough contrast so I was experimenting with that here.  

- Contact: 
    - Kept it pretty much the same as from the design. Tried to fix some spacing issues since that was in the feedback. I was having a lot of issues making sure that everything was formatted property without having a lot of white space on the bottom (especially on bigger screens). I'm not sure if the spacing between the title and the icons is quite right but it seemed right in my eyes. 
    - I'm not sure how much I like this design since its quite simple so I might try to add more going forward. Like adding a message chat form since those are quite common or a map of where I'm based out of. 











## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
